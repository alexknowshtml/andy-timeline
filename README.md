# Building Andy: The Development Timeline

**October 8 - December 29, 2025 (Days 0-89)**

This is the story of how Andy evolved from a blank repository to a fully operational AI executive assistant system with 44+ agents, automated workflows, self-healing infrastructure, production intelligence, a modular skills system, polished chat interface with synthesis intelligence, comprehensive API skills, voice input, Claude Memory integration, security hardening with push notifications, Memory Lane semantic memory, and auto-suggest buttons with agent-based architecture.

What started as "let's see what Claude Code can do" became a daily collaboration that fundamentally changed how I think about building software with AI.

## Week Summaries

### [Week 1: The Initial Sprint](./week-01-days-0-11.md) (Days 0-11)
The foundation. Built the agent architecture, integrated MCP servers, created the first commands. Went from zero to a working system with relationship tracking, email operations, and task management in 11 days.

### [Week 2: Production Maturation](./week-02-days-12-32.md) (Days 12-32)
The longest stretch - 21 days of grinding toward production quality. The link healer marathon, relationship automation breakthrough, schema validation, and the newsletter system taking shape.

### [Week 3: Timeline Automation](./week-03-days-33-39.md) (Days 33-39)
Documentation became self-maintaining. Timeline automation, documentation health systems, and relationship intelligence refinement. The system started caring for itself.

### [Week 4: Newsletter Polish](./week-04-days-40-47.md) (Days 40-47)
Meeting workflows matured. Newsletter reached production quality. Audit systems emerged. The focus shifted from building features to polishing what existed.

### [Week 5: Skills Infrastructure](./week-05-days-48-54.md) (Days 48-54)
The great scripts cleanup - 37 scripts archived, survivors converted to modular skills. The skills system emerged as the sustainable pattern for extending Andy.

### [Week 6: Chat UI & Synthesis](./week-06-days-55-61.md) (Days 55-61)
Andy Core's chat interface evolved. Sparkfile capture, image uploads, slash command intelligence. The Synthesis Intelligence system breakthrough - weekly learning consolidation.

### [Week 7: API-First Architecture](./week-07-days-62-68.md) (Days 62-68)
Everything became an API. Events, projects, tasks, workstreams - all accessible through skills. Voice input arrived. Claude Memory integration. Token usage observability.

### [Week 8: Security Hardening](./week-08-days-69-75.md) (Days 69-75)
Laravel Sanctum authentication. Credential scanning. Push notifications. Knowledge library reorganization. Light mode fixes. Security and polish in parallel.

### [Week 9: Memory Intelligence](./week-09-days-76-82.md) (Days 76-82)
Memory Lane semantic search. Host-bridge service extraction. Infisical migration complete. iMessage inbox triage. Token usage analytics. Multi-user foundation laid.

### [Week 10: Agent Refactoring](./week-10-days-83-89.md) (Days 83-89)
The /overview command migrated to agent-based architecture. Twitter API integration. Sessions API for historical context. Auto-suggest buttons. Open source preparation begins.

## The Timeline Curator Agent

This timeline is maintained by an automated agent that runs weekly. The [timeline-curator.md](./timeline-curator.md) file documents the agent's workflow, including:

- **Weekly Chapter Template** - The standard structure for each week's narrative
- **Day Entry Format** - How individual days are documented with commits, lessons learned, and metrics
- **Quality Verification** - Checks for navigation links, reflection sections, and narrative consistency
- **Writing Voice** - The "You did..." second-person narrative style that tells the story

The agent monitors git commits, identifies timeline-worthy developments, and proposes updates that maintain the serial narrative format.
