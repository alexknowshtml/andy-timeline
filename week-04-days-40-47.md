## Reflection: Week 4

---

### The Mistakes We Made

#### 1. Dark Mode CSS Specificity Battles

**Cost:** 6 commits on Day 47 just to fix event description colors in light/dark mode
**Fix:** Added `!important` to ALL dark mode overrides, removed inline styles
**Lesson Learned:** CSS specificity in email templates is a minefield. Test both modes in actual email clients, not just browser previews.

#### 2. Newsletter Light Mode Text Invisible

**Cost:** Day 44 published newsletter with dark mode rendering issues in ConvertKit
**Fix:** Progressive refinement through multiple commits until perfect
**Lesson Learned:** Email client rendering varies wildly. ConvertKit archives display differently than live emails.

#### 3. Date Attribution Errors

**Cost:** Multiple commits to fix "Wednesday not Thursday" and "Monday not Sunday" errors
**Fix:** Always verify day-of-week matches date before committing
**Lesson Learned:** Temporal context errors compound. A wrong day attribution causes downstream confusion.

---

### The Surprising Things

#### 1. 3 Commits Was a Full Day of Work

**Expected:** Busy days require many commits
**Actual:** Day 46 handled full relationship refresh with only 3 commits

When automation works, quiet days are success indicators. Minimal commits meant maximum efficiency.

#### 2. Meeting Processing Created Immediate Next-Meeting Prep

**Expected:** Prep and processing as separate activities
**Actual:** Processing Nov 11 meeting immediately generated Nov 18 prep

The virtuous cycle: process → prep → process → prep maintains context continuity.

#### 3. 36 Person Files in One Day

**Expected:** Relationship refresh would be gradual
**Actual:** Day 42 updated 36 person files across 3 refresh cycles (7 + 15 + 14)

Batch mode + multiple daily cycles = comprehensive relationship intelligence.

#### 4. Audit Trail System Emerged From Meeting Quality Needs

**Expected:** Audit trails were a future feature
**Actual:** Day 43 implemented comprehensive audit system to track meeting quality

Real-world usage drove feature development. Meeting processing revealed the need for quality tracking.
